Pico2Maple is a Dreamcast Maple bus emulator for the RP2350. The goal of this project of to provide a way to for people to use a variety of non-Dreamcast controllers and accessories on the Sega Dreamcast. Currently, it is possible to use several USB controllers, dongles, mice, and keyboards.

Pico2Maple also integrates VMU support with the ability to save to a microSD card.

Rumble emulation is available for PS4, PS5, and Xbox controllers connected via USB or BT.

# Download

Download the latest firmware:

* [pico2maple_2025-10-24](firmware/pico2maple_2025-10-24.uf2), USB only for Pico 2 and W boards.
* [pico2maple-w_2025-10-24](firmware/pico2maple-w_2025-10-24.uf2), USB and wireless for Pico 2 W boards.

To install the firmware on the Pico 2:

* Hold down the BOOTSEL button while connecting the Pico to a PC. This should make it appear as a USB storage device.
* Copy the pico2maple uf2 file to the Pico. It should reboot itself with the new firmware.

# Supported Controllers

For a more detailed breakdown of supported devices, please check out the [full device compatibility list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B8dfP6fLWeEofmxXTmYIQBTP0vJ_oXtTCgR17ZR1jMc/edit?usp=sharing).

## USB

* Steam Controller (wireless with dongle only)
* Sony PlayStation DS 3/4/5 Controllers
* XInput Controllers (OG Xbox, Xbox 360, One, Series, etc.)
* 8BitDo Wireless Dongle (great for connecting a huge variety of other controllers)
* 8BitDo SN30 Pro Xbox Edition
* USB Keyboards
* USB Mice

## BT

Pico2Maple uses Bluepad32 to handle BT connectivity. Check out [Bluepad32 supported controller list](https://bluepad32.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported_gamepads/) for a summary of supported devices.

The following controllers have been tested and confirmed working:

* Sony PlayStation DS 4/5 Controllers
* Xbox Series Wireless Controller (3-button version)
* Nintendo WiiU Pro Controller
* 8BitDo SN30 Pro
* 8BitDo SN30 Pro Xbox Edition

# Controls

Controls are mapped as you would expect with a few extra features:

* **Select + Right Bumper/Left Bumper** switch currently-active VMU bank (cycles through 10 different VMU banks).
* **Select + A** enable standard Dreamcast controller layout.
* **Select + B** enable all controller inputs which activates the second joystick and the C,Z buttons. Z is mapped to left bumper and C to right bumper. Not all games will accept this layout. 
* **Select + X** enable Twin Stick layout. Uses both controller joysticks, bumpers and triggers.
* **Select + Y** enable Fight Stick layout. This layout remaps RB and RT inputs to the Z and C buttons respectively. LB maps to RT.
* **Select + Dpad Right** enable a custom layout if one has been configured.
* **Select + Dpad Left** enable Racing Wheel layout. This layout will appear as an official Dreamcast Racing Wheel to games that support it.
* **Select + Dpad Down** enable/disable rumble

# Custom Controller Layouts

Pico2Maple has a fairly flexible controller remapping implementation which allows the entire controller to be reconfigured. Custom controller layouts are currently a work-in-progress and feedback is greatly appreciated.

The easiest method to create a layout is to use the [Pico2Maple Mapper tool](https://cluoma.github.io/Pico2Maple-config/). Custom layouts can then be uploaded to the device using an SD card or Raspberry Pi's [picotool](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool). Pre-compiled picotool binaries are [also available](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk-tools).

Optionally, for instructions on how to manually load a custom layout from an SD card, please check out the [Controller Layouts docs](docs/controller_layouts.md). Layouts loaded from an SD card will be stored internally so only need to be loaded once.

# Required Hardware

![Hardware needed](resources/images/hardware_components.jpg)

* Raspberry Pi Pico 2
* Dreamcast controller cable or plug
* Micro-USB to female USB-A adapter
* Optional:
  * SPI microSD breakout board and FAT32-formatted microSD card for saving VMU data ([example](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0CD79YZH6))
  * SSD1306 128x64 OLED display for displaying VMU images and selected VMU bank ([example](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0751LFCZT))

# Construction

Use a multi-meter to check which wires on the controller cable correspond to the following pins on the controller plug.

![Dreamcast controller plug](resources/images/dc_controller_plug.jpg)

Connect the controller wires to the labelled pins on the Pico below by soldering or otherwise.

![Pinout on the Pico 2](resources/images/pico2maple_pinout.jpg)

*Optionally* connect the SPI micro-SD board and the SSD1306 OLED screen to the labelled pins on the Pico 2.

With everything wired up, it's simply a matter of plugging in a USB device to the Pico 2 using the USB-A to Mini-USB adapter and plugging the Dreamcast controller cable into the console.

# Future Work

*Feedback on this project is very welcome!*

* Support a wider range of USB controllers (ongoing).
